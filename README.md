# CleaningDataProject

## Objective
This objective of this project is to:
 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Pre-requisites

 1. Download raw dataset [UCI HAR Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) 
 2. Extract raw dataset to a folder in working directory with name "UCI HAR Dataset"
 3. Load dplyr and reshape2 libraries
 4. Run the script from the working directory "run_analysis.R"
 5. Read Codebook.md in this project to see more details about the variables, the data, and any transformations or work  performed

## Dependencies

Packages: dplyr, reshape2
